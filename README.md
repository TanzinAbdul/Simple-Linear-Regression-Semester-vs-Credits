# 🎓 Simple Linear Regression Project: Predicting Completed Credits

Welcome to this beginner-friendly Machine Learning project! This repository contains a simple **Linear Regression** model designed to predict the number of academic credits completed based on the number of semesters completed.

## 📚 Project Overview

This project is a great starting point for anyone new to Machine Learning. It demonstrates the basics of Linear Regression, a fundamental algorithm in ML, by using a small dataset to make predictions.

### 🧠 What You'll Learn

- **Linear Regression**: Understand how to fit a line to data points and make predictions.
- **Data Visualization**: Learn to visualize the relationship between variables.
- **Model Evaluation**: See how well the model predicts the outcomes.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Basic knowledge of Python and Machine Learning

### Tutorial

1. **Clone the repository:(or you can downlod and run manually on jupyter)**

   ```bash
   git clone https://[github.com/your-username/simple-linear-regression-credits.git
   cd simple-linear-regression-credits](https://github.com/TanzinAbdul/Simple-Linear-Regression-Semester-vs-Credits)
2. **📊 Dataset**
   The dataset contains two columns:<br>
Number of Semesters: The input feature.<br>
Completed Credits: The output label.

4. **🔍 Visualization**<br>
After training the model, you'll visualize the relationship between the number of semesters and the credits completed, as well as the model's predictions.

5. **📝 Project Structure**<br>
