# ðŸŽ“ Simple Linear Regression Project: Predicting Completed Credits

Welcome to this beginner-friendly Machine Learning project! This repository contains a simple **Linear Regression** model designed to predict the number of academic credits completed based on the number of semesters completed.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

This project is a great starting point for anyone new to Machine Learning. It demonstrates the basics of Linear Regression, a fundamental algorithm in ML, by using a small dataset to make predictions.

### ðŸ§  What You'll Learn

- **Linear Regression**: Understand how to fit a line to data points and make predictions.
- **Data Visualization**: Learn to visualize the relationship between variables.
- **Model Evaluation**: See how well the model predicts the outcomes.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Basic knowledge of Python and Machine Learning
